## Kubernetes: "Kubernetes 101" Concepts
You probably heard a lot about Docker and Kubernetes. They are storming the world and providing a way to write and deploy applications very efficiently. But are you familiar with Kubernetes concepts? In this session, we will explain Kubernetes Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, Services, and so on through hands on labs to deploy and scale multi-tier web application.

#### Prerequisites: 
Familiarity with docker and containerization helps however it is not a must.
##### Run on IBM Cloud:
Follow this [link](https://ibm.biz/Bd2WCn) to create your cloud account. Reach out to the instructor to receive the credentials for a pre-provisioned Kubernetes cluster.

Alternatively, you can run the labs on your cluster by provisiong one on the IBM Cloud. Follow this [link](https://ibm.biz/Bd2WCn) to create your free cluster on IBM Cloud account. Select `Kubernetes Service` from the catalog and provision a lite cluster free of cost.

##### Run locally:
Install [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/) on your laptop and follow the lab instructions.

#### Instructions: 
Start with [Lab 1](https://github.com/rojanjose/kube101/tree/master/workshop/Lab1) to deploy the sample web application. </br>
Follow [Lab 2](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/tree/master/workshop/Lab2) to scale and update the deployments.</br>
Follow [Lab 3](https://github.com/IBM/kube101/tree/master/workshop/Lab3) to deploy and manage application using Kubernetes configuration files.

#### Call to Action
Create your Kube cluster across different availability zones to make the application disaster resistent. Try out the following patterns:</br>
